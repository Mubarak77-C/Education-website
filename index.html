                that are 100% virtual, excluding massively open online courses (MOOCs). Online learning, or virtual
                classes offered over the internet, is contrasted with traditional courses taken in a brick-and-mortar
                school building. It is the newest development in distance education that began in the mid-1990s with the
                spread of the internet and the World Wide Web.</p>

                Learner experience is typically asynchronous, but may
                also incorporate synchronous elements. The vast majority of institutions utilize a Learning Management
                System for the administration of online courses. As theories of distance education evolve, digital
                technologies to support learning and pedagogy continue to transform as well.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
                
                Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">The COVID-19 pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide,
                    leading to the near-total closures of schools, universities and colleges.
                    
                    Most governments around the world have temporarily closed educational institutions in an attempt to
                    contain the spread of COVID-19. As of 27 July 2020, approximately 1.725 billion learners are
                    currently affected due to school closures in response to the pandemic. According to UNICEF monitoring,
                    106 countries are currently implementing nationwide closures and 55 are implementing local closures,
                    impacting about 98.6 percent of the world's student population.</p>
